    <h3>Mushroom risotto recipe</h3>
    <p>This mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Broth: Homemade chicken broth is always the best choice for flavor, but you can use store-bought chicken broth for convenience.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: For sautéing the mushrooms and shallots. You won't be cooking at high heat, so it's okay to use extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mushrooms: This recipe uses a combination of portobello and white mushrooms. See how to clean mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Shallots: If you don't have shallots, you can substitute finely chopped yellow onion.</li>
        <li>Rice: To get that signature creamy risotto texture, you must use a particular type of short-grain, high-starch rice like Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano that releases its starch as you cook and stir.</li>
        <li>Wine: The first liquid you add to the pan after you sauté the rice is a half cup of white wine — it will absorb into every grain and create an essential layer of flavor. </li>
        <li>Butter: A generous amount of butter at the end adds more creamy texture and rich flavor.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese: You've come this far. Don't shortchange the flavor of your risotto by using anything other than freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Chives: Chives cut through the richness and add visual appeal, too. If you don't have chives, fresh parsley is a good substitute.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
